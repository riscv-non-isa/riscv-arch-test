# Coverage Statistic

The coverpoints used to create tests and capture the quality of the tests is available in the YAML
files in this folder:

- [dataset.yaml](dataset.yaml): this file includes all the common datasets that can be used across multiple instructions
- [rv32ic.yaml      ](rv32ic.yaml): this file includes the coverpoints for 32-bit compressed extension
- [rv32i_fencei.yaml](rv32i_fencei.yaml): this file includes the coverpoints for the fencei extension
- [rv32im.yaml      ](rv32im.yaml): this file includes the coverpoints for 32-bit mul-div extension
- [rv32i_priv.yaml  ](rv32i_priv.yaml): this file includes the coverpoints for 32-bit privilege cases
- [rv32i.yaml       ](rv32i.yaml): this file includes the coverpoints for 32-bit base extension
- [rv64ic.yaml      ](rv64ic.yaml): this file includes the coverpoints for 64-bit compressed extension
- [rv64i_fencei.yaml](rv64i_fencei.yaml): this file includes the coverpoints for the fencei extension
- [rv64im.yaml      ](rv64im.yaml): this file includes the coverpoints for 64-bit mul-div extension
- [rv64i_priv.yaml  ](rv64i_priv.yaml): this file includes the coverpoints for 64-bit privilege cases
- [rv64i.yaml       ](rv64i.yaml): this file includes the coverpoints for 64-bit base extension


## Directory structure
The rest of the directory is structured similar to how the riscv-test-suite directory is structured.
Each leaf folder contains the following 3 files:
1. ``suite_coverage.rpt`` : This is a YAML file contains nodes relevant to the current extension and the count of how many times a particular coverpoint was encountered.
2. ``coverage.html``: A HTML view of the report
4. ``style.css``: A style sheet for HTML file.

## Reports

HTML preview of the reports can be accessed directly through the following links:
