## Report Table

- The first column indicates the signature address and the data at that location in hexadecimal in the following format: 
  ```
  [Address]
  Data
  ```

- The second column captures all the coverpoints which have been captured by that particular signature location

- The third column captures all the insrtuctions since the time a coverpoint was
  hit to the point when a store to the signature was performed. Each line has
  the following format:
  ```
  [PC of instruction] : mnemonic
  ```
