== Introduction
=== About

This document describes the RISC-V Architectural Testing framework which is used to test if a RISC-V device's has understood and implemented the specifications correctly

* It explains the framework around the tests, the running of individual tests, and the suites of tests.

* It explains how to set up targets to run the tests.

This document is made freely available under a <<app_cc_by_4.0>>.

=== Intent of the architectural test suite

The RISC-V Architectural Tests are an evolving set of tests that are created to help ensure that software written for a given RISC-V Profile/Specification will run on all implementations that comply with that profile.

These tests also help ensure that the implementer has both understood and implemented the specification correctly.

The RISC-V Architectural Test suite is a minimal filter. Passing the tests and having the results approved by RISC-V International is a prerequisite to licensing the RISC-V trademarks in connection with the design. Passing the RISC-V Architectural Tests does not mean that the design complies with the RISC-V Architecture. These are only a basic set of tests checking important aspects of the specification without focusing on details.

The RISC-V Architectural Tests are not a substitute for rigorous design verification.

The result that the architecture tests provide to the user is an assurance that the specification has been interpreted correctly and the implementation under test (DUT) can be declared as RISC-V Architecture Test compliant.

=== Intended audience

This document is intended for design and verification engineers who wish to check if their RISC-V implementation (simulation models, HDL models, etc.) is compliant to the RISC-V specification. 

For those who wish to develop new architectural tests and/or to write or adapt their own test framework are suggested to read the link:../spec/TestFormatSpec.adoc[`Test Format Spec`].

//=== Future work
//
//This is a work in progress. A number of areas need resolving before the work is complete, and are recorded here so they do not get forgotten.
//
//Consider whether `compliance_test.h` is needed It's not clear if this belongs in target directories, or if it is needed at all.
//
// Generalize Makefile configuration At present each platform requires editing of the makefile, and many areas are not even fully parameterized.  Again we wish to explore a wider range of platforms before deciding what needs parameterization.  For now `COMPILE_TARGET` allows a choice between GCC and LLVM.  More generally, we know that with tools like _autotools_ and _cmake_ this is a well understood problem to solve.
//
//Free up all registers for compliance testing At present some platforms have macros which use some registers in set up and verification, thus excluding them from compliance testing. We believe careful structuring of the macros will mean this problem can be avoided in the future, thus avoiding any registers being excluded from compliance testing.

== Repository structure

The top level directory contains :

 - a `README.md` file providing high-level details about the RISC-V Architecture Testing Framework. 
 - top level `Makefile` for running the tests on a RISC-V implementation.
 - `ChangeLog` for logging changes with respect to code.
 -  complete license files for the Creative Commons and BSD licenses used by the task group.  

There are then five top level directories.

`doc`:: All the documentation for the project, written using _AsciiDoc_.

`coverage`:: This directory contains a sub-directory structure similar to the `riscv-test-suite` directory. The coverage reports of each test-suite are available in the corresponding directories. The reports are available in the html and yaml formats. The directory also contains the `coverpoint.yaml` file which indicates all the coverpoints of interest which are covered by all the tests in the `riscv-test-suite` directory.

`riscv-target`:: Contains a further subdirectory for each target, within which are placed the `compliance_model.h` header for that target and a `device` directory for all the devices of that target. If the `$TARGETDIR` environment variable is set to another directory, the scripts will search this directory for targets instead.

`riscv-test-env`:: This contains the `verify.sh` script which checks if the signatures generated the riscv-target device match the statically hosted reference signatures at the end of simulation. 

`riscv-test-suite`:: This contains a further `env` subdirectory which contains the `compliance_test.h` and the `encoding.h` file which includes common assembly macros and routines which is used across the tests in the suite. Further directories are present which contain the actual architectural tests. The names and structure of these directories is based on the link:../test-pool structure guideline highlighted above. 

`riscv-ovpsim`:: This contains a copy of the Imperas OVP riscvOVPsim simulator for use in architectural testing. It includes a subdirectory of examples with pre-compiled .elf files and has binaries of the simulator for Linux64 and Windows64. This is referenced by the makefiles for developing and running the architectural test suites. riscvOVPsim can run all the tracing and assertion macros used in the tests.

== Vocabulary
=== The architectural test

At the heart of the testing infrastructure is the detailed <<The architectural tests, _architectural test_>> available as `.S` assembly files. The specification and format of the tests is defined in the link:./TestFormatSpec.adoc[`Test Format Specification`].

=== The architectural test pool

The <<The architectural test, _architectural tests_>> are grouped into different functional test suites targeting the different subsets of the RISC-V specification. For more details on the test-pool structure, hierarchy and conventions please refer to the link:./TestFormatSpec.adoc[`Test Format Specification`].

For information on the currently supported different test suites, look here: link:../riscv-test-suite/README.md[../riscv-test-suite/README.md]

=== The test signature

Each test in the <<The architectural test pool, _architectural test pool_>> generates a <<The test signature, _test signature_>>, which represents the data written into specific memory locations during the execution of the test. The signature typically will record values (or sanitised values) of the operations carried out in the test. More details on the format and nature of the signatures is available in the link:./TestFormatSpec.adoc[`Test Format Specification`]

=== The reference signature

In order to claim that a device/implementation has passed the RISC-V Architecture Tests, the <<The test signature, _test signatures_>> obtained from the execution of the tests on the implementation need to be compared against a set of _golden_ <<The reference signatures, _reference signature_>>. These reference signatures are currently generated by the link:https://github.com/rems-project/sail-riscv[`RISC-V SAIL`] formal model and statically hosted in the repository for each test.

=== The test target
The <<The test target,_test target_>> can be either a RISC-V Instruction Set Simulator (ISS), a RISC-V emulator, a RISC-V RTL model running on an HDL simulator, a RISC-V FPGA implementation or a physical chip. Each of the target types offers specific features and represents specific interface challenges. It is a role of the  <<The target shell, _target shell_>> to handle different targets while using the same <<The architectural test pool,_architectural test pool_>> as a test source.

=== The target shell
The <<The target shell, _target shell_>> is the software and hardware environment around the <<The test target,_test target_>> that enables it to communicate with the framework, including assembling and linking tests, loading tests into memory, executing tests, and extracting the signature. The input to the <<The target shell, _target shell_>> is a .S <<The architectural test,_architectural test_>> file, and the output is a <<The test signature,_test signature_>>.


//=== The Test Virtual Machine
//
//The test runs in the context of a _Test Virtual Machine_ (TVM) as defined and available at https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests. There will be a different TVM for each instruction subset and each profile.

//=== The target environment
//
//A specific target will need to be chosen and setup to run the Test. This can be an Instruction Set Simulator (ISS), full system simulator (emulator), HDL simulator, FPGA prototype, or a board/chip, etc.  The test runs in the context of a TVM and is set up to run on the specific target.  The _target environment_ controls the loading of the test plus TVM onto the target, configures the device if needed, controls the execution, and then extracts the signature.

//=== The processor configuration (device configuration)
//
//The RISC-V specification allows many optional instructions, registers, and other features.  Many targets have a fixed selection of these optional items which cannot be changed. For example, a chip is fixed in the mask.  A simulator on the other hand may implement all known options and will need to be constrained to have only the required options available.  There will need to be processor configuration for those target devices which need to be constrained to only reflect the features of the device being compliance tested. This is essential when writing compliance tests to ensure that only available options are used in the tests.

//=== The test signature
//
//The _test signature_ is defined as reference data written into memory during the execution of the test.  It should record values and results of the operation of the Test. It is expected that an implementation, at the end of a test, dumps the signature in to a file such that only 4-bytes are written per line, starting with the most-significant byte on the left.

//=== The test framework
//
//This works at several levels.  At the lowest level it runs a test with a TVM on a specific configured target device and compares the test’s output test signature against the test reference signature and reports if there is any difference. A difference indicates that the target has failed that specific compliance test.
//
//The test framework allows different test suites to be run depending on the capabilities of the target
//
//The test framework collates the results of all the Tests that comprise a Test Suite and reports the overall results.

//== Developing new tests
//=== Structure
//
//* Clone directory structure of an existing test suite alongside the RV32I tree.
//
//* This must include test and reference signature directories (`src` and `references`).
//
//* Check the target environment setup files.
//
//* Check the processor configuration files.
//
//=== Process
//
//This description assumes the use of a configurable simulator with good trace and debug capabilities.
//
//* Work on one test at a time.
//
//* Ensure that the processor configuration is set appropriately.
//
//* Use the `RVTEST` macros (defined in `compliance_io.h`) to make it easy to see the details of a Test’s execution. There are macros for assertions (`RVTEST_IO_ASSERT_GPR_EQ`) and tracing (`RVTEST_IO_WRITE_STR`) which are empty on targets that can not implement them.
//
//* Assuming you are developing the test on a simulator, use the simulator’s tracing capabilities, especially a register change mode to single step your test examining all changing registers etc. to ensure your test is stimulating what is intending.
//
//* Make sure that the signature you generate at the end of the run shows adequate internal test state such that any checks do report as fails if wrong.
//
//* When you are satisfied that the test does what is intended and that the test signature is correct, copy this into a test reference signature (in the references directory).
//
//For a test suite to be complete it needs to have tests that exercise the full functionality of what it is intended to test. There are tools available to measure instruction and other resource coverage. These should be used to ensure that 100% of the intended instructions have been tested.

//== Test framework
//
//For running compliance tests, the Test Virtual Machine (TVM) “p” available at https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests is utilized.
//
//In addition to using the basic functionality of the TVM, the script for running compliance tests runs the test on the target and then performs comparison of the target’s generated test signature to the manually reviewed test reference signature.
//
//See the chapter below for selecting and setting up the target (simulator, or hardware, etc.).
//
//If using a target that requires the processor to be configured, see the chapter below on processor configuration.
//
//You will also need to have a suitable compiler tool chain (GCC or LLVM) installed in your environment and available on your path.
//
//Tests are run by commands in the top level `Makefile` which has targets for simulate and verify
//
//[source,make]
//----
//RISCV_TARGET ?= riscvOVPsim
//RISCV_DEVICE ?= rv32i
//RISCV_PREFIX ?= riscv64-unknown-elf-
//
//simulate:
//        make RISCV_TARGET=$(RISCV_TARGET) \
//             RISCV_DEVICE=$(RISCV_DEVICE) \
//             RISCV_PREFIX=$(RISCV_PREFIX) \
//             run -C $(SUITEDIR)
//
//verify:
//    riscv-test-env/verify.sh
//----

//== Setting the target environment
//
//The target environment needs setting up to allow the compliance tests to be run on the target.  This can be used while developing compliance test suites or it can be used with new targets to see if they correctly execute the compliance test suites and are compliant!
//
//This chapter provides information on the currently available targets and includes a short tutorial on how to add a new target.

== Porting a new target


In this section, a short tutorial on how to add a user target to the RISC-V Architectural Test Framework is provided.

The following steps demonstrate an example in which a target was replaced by the RISCV-ISA-SIM 
(a.k.a Spike). In a similar way, any RISC-V ISA simulator or any RTL simulation model of the 
RISC-V processor can be ported as a potential target for testing.

=== Setup environment variables

NOTE: `ROOTDIR` will always point to the riscv-compliance repo.

1. Clone the repository: 

  ---
  git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-compliance.git
  cd riscv-compliance

  ---

2. Open the `Makefile.include` available in the root folder of the repository and edit the following
variables based on your target:
   
 a. `TARGETDIR` : set `TARGETDIR` to point to the directory which contains a sub-folder in the same name
 as the target. For example, the compliance repo includes the targets: sail-riscv-c and spike
 under the `riscv-target` folder, in which case we set the `TARGETDIR` to riscv-target as shown
 below. One can set this completely arbitrary paths as suitable by the user.
 
 
   ---
   export TARGETDIR ?= $(ROOTDIR)/riscv-target
   
   ---

 b. `XLEN`: set XLEN to max supported XLEN. Allowed values are 32 and 64.

   ---
   export XLEN 							?= 64

   ---

c. `RISCV_TARGET`: set this variable to the name of the target. A folder of the same name must exist in 
the `TARGETDIR` directory

  ---
  export RISCV_TARGET       ?= spike

  ---

d. `RISCV_DEVICE`: set the `RISCV_DEVICE` environment to the extension you want to compile, simulate and verify. Leave
this blank if you want to iterate through all the supported extensions of the target. Allowed values
are the names of the extensions supported by your target like: I, M, C, Zifencei, etc

  ---
  export RISCV_DEVICE       ?= 

  ---

e. `RISCV_TARGET_FLAGS`: set this to a string which needs to be passed to your targets Makefile.include files

  ---
  export RISCV_TARGET_FLAGS ?= 

  ---

f. `RISCV_ASSERT`: set this if you want to enable assertions on the test-suites. **Currently no tests support assertions.**
  
  ---
  export RISCV_ASSERT       ?= 0

  ---

g. `JOBS`: set the number of parallel jobs (along with any other arguments) you would like to
execute. Note that the target needs to  be coded in such a way to support parallel execution. Some
targets use common intermediate files, rather than unique files, which makes them unsuitable for 
parallel execution, these targets will need to be re-coded.
  
  ---
  JOBS= -j1

  ---

3. Now inside your `TARGETDIR/RISCV_TARGET` directory you will need to create the following files:

a. `compliance_model.h`: A header file containing the definition of the various target specific
assembly macros that are required to compile and simulate the tests. The list and definition of the 
required target specific macros is avialble in the link:../spec/TestFormatSpec.adoc[Test Format
Specification]

b. `link.ld`: A linker script to compile the tests for your target.

c. Any other files required by the target (configuration scripts, logs, etc.) can also be placed in
this directory.

4. Inside the `TARGETDIR/RISCV_TARGET` directory create a new folder named: `device`. If your device
is a 32-bit target then create a directory `device/rv32i_m`. If your device is a 64-bit target then
create a directory `device/rv64i_m`. If your target is configurable on the `XLEN` parameter then
both the folders need to be created. 

5. Within the `rv32i_m`/`rv64i_m` directories sub-folders in the name of the extensions supported
by the target need to be created. For eg. A target supporting the ISA RV32IMC_Zifence will have the
following directory structure:
   
   ---
   - rv32i_m/I
   - rv32i_m/M
   - rv32i_m/C
   - rv32i_m/privilege
   - rv32i_m/Zifencei

   ---

6. Each of the above extension directories will now need to include a file: `Makefile.include` which
defines the following Makefile variables:

a. `RUN_TARGET`:: This variable needs to include commands and steps to execute an ELF on target device. Note here that this variable should include all the necessary steps and arguments to run that specific test-suite. For example, in case of spike for the `rv32i_m/C` test-suite the corresponding `Makefile.include` has the `--isa=rv32ic` argument as oppsed to just `--isa=rv32i` for the base `rv32i_m/I` test-suite. This variable should also include other steps to extract and sanitize the signature file as well for each test. The only argument available to this variable if the compiled `elf` file.

b. `COMPILE_TARGET`:: This variable should include the commands and steps required to compile an assembly test for the target under each extension mentioned above. Note currently only the GCC compiler is supported which takes `march` and `mabi` arguments from the corresponding architectural suite framework. This variable will more or less be the same across test-suites. The only argument available to this variable is the assembly file of one architectural test.

The following figure depicts the final directory structure of a target device that should get craeted at the end of the above steps:

=== Generating Signature

As previously mentioned the execution of each test on the target must generate a signature file. The name of the signature file should be `<test-file-name.signature_output>`. The signature file should follow the guidelines mentioned in the link:../spec/TestFormatSpec.adoc[`Test Format Specification`].

In case of spike, we have ensured that the signature region is bounded by the the labels: `begin_signature` and `end_signature`. This is enforced in the `RVMODEL_DATA_BEGIN` and `RVMODEL_DATA_END` macros defined in the `riscv-target/spike/compliance_model.h` file. Additionally, if you look closely at the `RUN_TARGET` variable defined in the `Makefile.include` files of the spike target, it includes a few bash commands to sanitize the signature produced from spike. This is done to conform the final signature file to the specification defined in the link:../spec/TestFormatSpec.adoc[`Test Format Specification`].

=== Compile, simulate and verify the tests

Once you have ported your target to the riscv-compliance framework by following the above steps, you
are now ready to compile, simulate and verify the tests on your target

If you would like to compile, simulate and verify all the extension tests applicable to your target
simply run `make` from the `ROOTDIR`. 

NOTE: For the above to work the `RISCV_DEVICE` in  `ROOTDIR/Makefile.include` must be left empty. 

If you would like to only compile the tests for a particular extension you can use the following
command. 

  make RISCV_DEVICE=M compile

The arguments to the `RISCV_DEVICE` variable must be the extensions supported by the target. 
NOTE: If `RISCV_DEVICE` is not defined/empty it will default to the `I` extension which is necessary
for all targets.

To simulate the compiled tests on your target:

  make RISCV_DEVICE=M simulate

NOTE: If `RISCV_DEVICE` is not defined/empty it will default to the `I` extension which is necessary
for all targets.

To verify if the generated signatures match the corresponding reference signatures.

  make RISCV_DEVICE=M verify 

NOTE: If `RISCV_DEVICE` is not defined/empty it will default to the `I` extension which is necessary
for all targets.

All the above steps create and modify files in the `work` directory created in `ROOTDIR` folder. To
clean the `workdir` simple run :

  make clean

By default the working directory is set to `ROOTDIR/work`. This can be overwritten by assigning a
new working directory path via the command line. Note, the path must be absolute and not relative :

  make WORK=/home/me/my_path/mywork clean compile simulate

//Once you have ported your target using the steps you can then run the execute the architectural test framework using the following steps:
//
//1. go to the root directory of the repository: `cd riscv-compliance`
//2. in the Makefile available in the root directory perform the following changes:
//   - change `XLEN` to the default XLEN value of the target/device. Eg. 32 or 64
//   - change `RISCV_TARGET` to the name of your target. Eg. spike
//3. save the changes.
//4. in the terminal, at the root directory, type `make`.
//
//Performing the `make` first creates a `work` directory where all the compilation and simulation of the tests on the target will be performed.
//Based on the `XLEN` value set in the Makfile either the `rv32i_m` test-suite or the `rv64i_m` test-suite is chosen. Further, based on the names of the subdirectories defined in the `device` directory of the target the corresponding tests are enabled and run on the target. Once all the tests from a suite are executed the `riscv-test-env/verify.sh` bash script is run which compares the generated signatures with the corresponding reference signatures and reports an error or an `OK` as the case maybe.
//

//At the moment the riscvOVPsim target will support parallel execution by default, and will select the options -j8 --max-load=4 - these can be overridden either by disable (PARALLEL=0), or redefinition JOBS="-j2 --max-load=2"



//* Redefine macros in `ISA/src/compliance_test.h` and `binary_coding/src/compliance_test.h`.
//+
//For example, to support Codasip ISA simulator as Target, it was necessary to redefine `RV_COMPLIANCE_HALT macro`, `RV_COMPLIANCE_DATA_BEGIN` macro and `RV_COMPLIANCE_DATA_END` macro in `ISA/compliance_test.h` in the following way:
//+
//[source,c]
//----
//#define RV_COMPLIANCE_HALT
//        add     x31, x0, 1
//        sw      x31, codasip_syscall, t0
//----
//
//* This means that on the address defined by `codasip_syscall`, the 1 value is stored and this is interpreted as `HALT` for the Codasip ISA simulator.
//+
//[source,c]
//----
//#define RV_COMPLIANCE_DATA_BEGIN
//        .align  4;
//        .global codasip_signature_start;
//codasip_signature_start:
//----
//+
//[source,c]
//----
//#define RV_COMPLIANCE_DATA_END
//        .align  4;
//        .global codasip_signature_end;
//codasip_signature_end:
//----

//* The Codasip ISA simulator dumps data from the addresses bounded by labels `codasip_signature_start` and `codasip_signature_end` to `stdout`.  The dumped data represent the results of the tests.
//
//* Modify Makefiles in `ISA/Makefile` and `binary_coding/Makefile`.  It is important to change tools that are evaluated and parameters that are passed to the tools.
//+
//For example, to support the Codasip ISA simulator as the device under test
//(DUT), it was necessary to change `RISCV_SIM` from `spike` to
//`codix_berkelium-ia-isimulator –r` and parameters for running the simulator
//from `+signature=$(work_dir)/$<.signature.output` to `–info 5` plus handle
//redirection to a file by `1>$(work_dir)/$<.signature.output`.

//== Configuring the target device
//
//This section is for how to specify which optional parts are being used
//
//NOTE: This is primarily for simulators.
//
//In the directory `riscv-target/*/device` there are directories that have Makefile fragments that configure the simulator to simulate only those parts of the RISC-V specification that is required for the specific target device being tested.
//
//For example for the riscvOVPsim to be configured to be a RV32I
//[source,make]
//----
//RUN_TARGET= \
//        riscvOVPsim.exe --variant RV32I --program $(work_dir_isa)/$< \
//            --signaturedump \
//            --override riscvOVPsim/cpu/sigdump/SignatureFile=$(work_dir_isa)/$(*).signature.output \
//            --override riscvOVPsim/cpu/sigdump/ResultReg=3 \
//            --override riscvOVPsim/cpu/simulateexceptions=T \
//            --logfile $(work_dir_isa)/$@
