# CHANGELOG

## [4.1.0] - 2026-09-03

### Overview

ACT 4.1 expands architectural coverage and test generation and improves privileged and vector test support. Note that many of the config files have been significantly updated. It is recommended to start with a fresh copy of an example config and recreate your DUT config, especially for the linker script.

### Details

- Many privileged tests were added or improved, including Zawrs, Sstvala, Ssccptr, Zama16b, Zkr, Exceptions, Interrupts, PMP, and others
- Vx and Vls test generation is now enabled by default on supported DUTs
- All unprivileged and many privileged tests have been ported to run in lower privilege modes and use T-SBI

## [4.0.0] - 2026-04-16

### Overview

ACT 4.0 is a major overhaul of the RISC-V Architecture Certification Test suite. The old `riscof`/`riscv-ctg`/`riscv-isac`/`riscv-config` flow has been replaced with an entirely new Python-based test compilation framework, a new `testgen` package for generating tests, and SystemVerilog-based functional coverage. The tests are now self-checking and many more RISC-V extensions are now supported.

### Details

- Complete rewrite of the test framework, replacing `riscof`/`riscv-ctg`/`riscv-isac` with a new Python-based system
- Custom Python build system, replacing generated Makefiles from `riscof`
- Configuration validation driven by [RISC-V Unified Database (UDB)](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-unified-db)
- All tests are now self-checking and report pass/fail status without post-processing using expected results from the [RISC-V Sail model](https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv)
  - Detailed failure logging with failing instructions, expected result, and mismatched actual result
- Coverage collection using industry-standard SystemVerilog functional coverage with coverpoints linked to normative rules from the [ISA manual](https://docs.riscv.org/reference/isa/unpriv/intro.html)
- The [Certification Test Plan (CTP)](https://riscv.github.io/riscv-arch-test/ctp.html) contains details on what features each test and coverpoint exercise
- The ACT4 tests have been validated on the Spike, QEMU, and Whisper simulators
