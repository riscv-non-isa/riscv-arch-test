	2020-11-24 Neel Gala <neelgala@incoresemi.com>
		* added MIGRATION.adoc in doc directory to indicate how old framework targets can work with
		  changes made as part of this PR
		* updated doc/README.adoc to avoid the word "compliance" and updated the section on porting a new
		  target to the framework.
		* Added an example_target directory to host dummy files which can be used as a starting point for
		  porting targets. This was provided by MarcKarasek.
		* migrated/ported existing targets (except codasip and sifive-formal) to the new framework
		  changes.
		* in riscv-test-env/p/riscv_test.h changed names of RVTEST_[CODE/DATA]_[BEGIN/END] to
		  RVTEST_[CODE/DATA]_[BEGIN/END]_OLD respectively to avoid conflicts with the new framework macros.
		* in riscv-test-env/p/riscv_test.h re-strutucture RVTEST_DATA_BEGIN_OLD/END to ensure that all
		  target specific data contents are introduced in RVTEST_DATA_END after the signature.
		* added new file riscv-test-suite/env/arch_test.h which contains the macros used by the new set of 
		  tests. A symlink to this in the riscv-test-env directory is also created. The arch_test also 
		  includes aliases for the old macros. 
		* encoding.h moved to riscv-test-suite/env and a symlink to this file exists in riscv-test-env.

		* new set of tests with better coverage for rv[32/64][I,M,C, Zifencei] added. Almost all tests 
			were generated using the open source riscv_ctg tool. A few tests like fence, fencei, ebreak, 
			ecall, etc were handwritten/modified to follow the new macro conventions.
		* Updated TestFormatSpec to avoid the word compliance and also updated the definitions of macros
		  and signatures
		* created a root-level Makefile.include to decouple the Makefile and target specific settings. 
		* Added riscv-target and Makefile.include to the .gitignore file to stop tracking target specific
		  changes.
		* Added special targets for compile(build), simulate(run) and verify in the Makefiles of each
		  test-suite.
		* the existing riscv-targets have been either updated for the new framework or migrated to the
			framework.

	    * Added Top Level Variable to Makefile RISCV_TARGET_FLAGS, 
	    in the case of the RISCV_TARGET this can be passed and appended to the invocation

	    to perform tracing. The value of this flag will be target specific
	        make RISCV_ISA=rv32i RISCV_TEST=I-ADD-01 RISCV_TARGET_FLAGS="--trace"
	    This is has also been added to all other targets to allow target configuration from
	    the commandline
	
	2019-10-07 Philipp Wagner <phw@lowrisc.org>
	    * When executing the test suite, Ibex always writes an instruction
	      log. Update the Makefile to write it to a test-specific location
	      (next to all other log files).
	    * On Ibex, provide an additional .objdump-noalias disassembly file
	      with no aliases and numeric register names (instead of ABI names).
	      This file matches the Ibex trace and can be used to debug the test
	      runs.
