# RISC-V Compliance Task Group

This is a repository for the work of the RISC-V Foundation Compliance Task Group. The repository owners are:
- Neel Gala (InCore Semiconductors)
- Marc Karasek (Inspire Semiconductors)

Details of the RISC-V Foundation, the work of its task groups, and how to become a member can be found at [riscv.org](https://riscv.org/).

For more details and documentation on the current testing framework see: [doc/README.adoc](doc/README.adoc)

For more details on the test format spec see: [spec/TestFormatSpec.adoc](spec/TestFormatSpec.adoc)

## Test Disclaimers

The following are the exhaustive list of disclaimers that can be used as waivers by target owners 
when reporting the status of pass/fail on the execution of the architectural suite on their respective targets.

1. The references uploaded for the following misaligned load/store tests will match targets which do 
   not support misaligned load/stores in hardware. Targets with hardware misaligned support for 
   load/stores will fail these tests.

   1. rv32i_m/privilege/src/misalign-[lb[u],lh[u],lw,sh,sb,sw]-01.S
   2. rv64i_m/privilege/src/misalign-[lb[u],lh[u],lw[u],ld,sb,sh,sw,sd]-01.S

2. The references uploaded for the following misaligned instruction tests will match targets which 
   have compressed extension support enabled by default. Targets without the compressed extension 
   support will fail the following tests:
   1. rv[32/64]i_m/privilege/src/misalign-b[ge[u],lt[u],eq,ne]-01.S
   2. rv[32/64]i_m/privilege/src/misalign[1,2]-jalr-01.S

3. The machine mode trap handler used in the privilege tests assumes one of the following conditions. 
   Targets not satisfying any of the following conditions are bound to fail the entire 
   rv32i_m/privilege and rv64i_m/privilege tests:
   1. The target must have implemented mtvec which is completely writable by the test in machine mode.
   2. The target has initialized mtvec, before entering the test (via RVMODEL_BOOT), to point to a memory location which has both read and write permissions.

## Contribution process

You are encouraged to contribute to this repository by submitting pull requests and by commenting on pull requests submitted by other people.

- Where a pull request is non-controversial one of the repository owners will immediately merge it. The repository uses rebase merges to maintain a linear history.

- Other pull requests will be publicised to the task group for comment and decision at a subsequent meeting of the group. Everyone is encouraged to comment on a pull request. Such pull requests will be merged by when a consensus/decision has been reached by the task group.
