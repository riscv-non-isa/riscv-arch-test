# RISC-V Architectural Certification Tests

The RISC-V Architectural Certification Tests (ACTs) are a set of assembly language tests designed to certify that a design faithfully implements the RISC-V specification. These are not verification tests and additional verification should be run on all processors.

The Architectural Certification Tests are used with the ACT4 Framework, a Makefile and Python based tool that replaces the deprecated riscof tool. The ACT4 Framework generates and compiles self-checking tests in Executable Linkable Format (ELF) for a device under test (DUT) and optionally collects coverage showing that the tests hit the coverpoints that check the normative rules. The user is then responsible for running all of the ELF files on the DUT with the user's own testbench. Each test reports success or failure, and if possible prints error messages to a console.

The ACT4 Framework requires a UDB configuration file specifying the extensions and parameters supported by the DUT; an rvmodel_macros.h file defining DUT-specific operations such as printing to a console, terminating a test with a success/failure code, and generating interrupts; and a linker script describing the DUT memory map.

RISC-V is highly configurable, such as whether misaligned accesses are allowed or how many PMP registers are implemented. Therefore, the expected results of the tests differ based on the configuration of the DUT. The ACT4 Framework selects the appropriate tests to compile based on the capabilities of the DUT. It then uses the [RISC-V Sail reference model](https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv), configured to match the DUT, to compute the expected results of each test. These results are then compiled into the final self-checking ELFs.

The Architectural Certification Tests are described in full detail in the [Certification Test Plan](https://riscv.github.io/riscv-arch-test/ctp.html) (CTP). The ACT4 Framework principles of operation are detailed in [LINK COMING SOON]. For details on adding more tests and coverpoints, see the [ACT Developer's Guide](./docs/DeveloperGuide.md).

## Getting Started

This section provides detailed step-by-step instructions to set up the ACT environment and generate ELFs for a Device Under Test (DUT).

### Prerequisites

The ACTs require several tools to generate and run correctly. Ensure all of the following tools are installed before proceeding.

#### 1. System Dependencies

The ACT4 framework uses `make` to run top-level commands. `git` is needed to clone the `riscv-arch-test` repository. Both of these packages are available in your system package manager.

To install system dependencies:

```bash
# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install make git

# On Fedora/CentOS/RHEL
sudo dnf install make git
```

#### 2. `mise` (Tool Manager)

The test generator and framework are written in Python. The recommended way of installing and running Python is using the `uv` project manager, which will handle Python versions, virtual environments, and dependencies transparently.

The framework also relies on the [`riscv-unified-db`](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-unified-db) (UDB) gem, which requires Ruby and Bundler.

The recommended way of installing both of these tools (`uv` and Ruby) is using [`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev/). `mise` handles tool versions and installation automatically — you don't need to install uv, Python, Ruby, or UDB manually.

To install mise:

```bash
curl https://mise.jdx.dev/install.sh | sh
```

After installation, verify mise is available:

```bash
mise --version
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> For more details on mise and alternate installation methods, see the [mise getting started guide](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html).
>
> If you do not want to install mise, you can install `uv` directly (see the [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)) or use an existing Python environment as described in [Installing without uv or mise](#installing-without-uv-or-mise).

> [!NOTE]
>
> See note on enabling trust in the `.mise.toml` file below.

##### Installing without uv or mise

If you already have your own Python environment, you can install the
framework packages into it with `pip` instead of using `mise`/`uv`. You are
responsible for providing Python 3.10+, and Ruby/Bundler must be installed
separately (see the [UDB repository](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-unified-db)).

Activate your venv, then from the cloned repository run:

```bash
pip install -e ./framework -e ./generators/testgen -e ./generators/coverage
```

With the venv active, `make`, `make tests`, `make coverage`, `make spike-*`,
and the other documented targets work as usual.

#### 3. RISC-V Compiler (GCC or LLVM)

The ACT framework is compatible with GCC/Binutils or LLVM/Clang. Only the latest release of each is officially supported and tested in CI.
Currently, that is GCC 15/Binutils 2.44 or LLVM/Clang 21.

This guide uses GCC, but if you prefer LLVM you just need to set the path for the compiler appropriately when [creating your config file](#act-framework-configuration-file). See [config/sail/sail-rv64-max-clang/test_config.yaml](./config/sail/sail-rv64-max-clang/test_config.yaml) for an example.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The toolchain installation will take significant time (up to several hours depending on your system).

To install `riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc`:

```bash
# On Ubuntu/Debian: install dependencies
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake autotools-dev curl python3 python3-pip  \
  python3-tomli libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev gawk build-essential bison   \
  flex texinfo gperf libtool patchutils bc zlib1g-dev libexpat-dev ninja-build \
  git cmake libglib2.0-dev libslirp-dev libncurses-dev

# On Fedora/CentOS/RHEL: install dependencies
sudo dnf install autoconf automake python3 libmpc-devel mpfr-devel gmp-devel \
  gawk  bison flex texinfo patchutils gcc gcc-c++ zlib-devel expat-devel     \
  libslirp-devel ncurses-devel

# On all distros: clone and build the toolchain:
git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain
cd riscv-gnu-toolchain
./configure --prefix=</path/to/install> --with-multilib-generator="rv32e-ilp32e--;rv32i-ilp32--;rv32im-ilp32--;rv32iac-ilp32--;rv32imac-ilp32--;rv32imafc-ilp32f--;rv32imafdc-ilp32d--;rv64i-lp64--;rv64ic-lp64--;rv64iac-lp64--;rv64imac-lp64--;rv64imafdc-lp64d--;rv64im-lp64--;"
sudo make  # sudo may be required depending on the selected `prefix`
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't have sudo access, you can install the tools locally in your home directory.
> Simply replace `</path/to/install>` with a local directory (e.g., `$HOME/riscv`) and run `make` without `sudo`.

**Important**: Add the toolchain to your `PATH` by adding this line to your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export PATH="/path/to/install/bin:$PATH"
```

Then verify the installation (from a new shell):

```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc --version
```

For more information or if you have issues installing the RISC-V toolchain, refer to the [riscv-gnu-toolchain README](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain).

#### 4. RISC-V Sail Reference Model

The ACTs use the RISC-V Sail model to generate expected results. It is currently compatible with version 0.13 of the model.

To install the sail model:

```bash
curl --location https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv/releases/download/0.13/sail-riscv-$(uname)-$(arch).tar.gz | sudo tar xvz --directory=/path/to/install --strip-components=1
```

> [!NOTE]
> Replace `/path/to/install` with your desired directory location.
> This is simpler if it matches the directory used for the `riscv-gnu-toolchain` so both tools share the same `bin` folder.

Add `/path/to/install/bin` to your `PATH` if you used a different directory than for the `riscv-gnu-toolchain`.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't have sudo access, you can extract the Sail model into your home directory by specifying a local path: `curl --location <url> | tar xvz --directory=$HOME/riscv/ --strip-components=1`

Verify the installation:

```bash
sail_riscv_sim --version
```

For more details on the RISC-V Sail model and alternate installation methods, see the [sail-riscv README](https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv).

### Get Source Code

Clone the `riscv-arch-test` repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-arch-test
```

On entering the top-level directory of the repository for the first
time, or on the first use of one of the build commands below, you may
see messages or a prompt from `mise` requiring enabling trust before
the `.mise.toml` configuration file can be used. This can be done by
selecting `Yes` in the prompt or with the following command in the
top-level directory of the repository:

```bash
mise trust .mise.toml

```

### Configuration

Several configuration files are needed to tell the ACT framework how to find your tools, what extensions and parameters are supported by your implementation, and how to perform implementation-specific functions.

Create a configuration directory for your DUT. If adding the configuration to the `riscv-arch-test` repo, it is recommended to place it under `config/cores/<vendor>/<dut-config-name>/`. For example: `config/cores/cvw/cvw-rv64gc/`. Configs can also be placed outside the repo. See [Generate Tests and Compile ELFs](#generate-tests-and-compile-elfs) for instructions on specifying the desired config file.

Your configuration directory should contain the following files:

1. `test_config.yaml` - ACT Framework configuration
2. `<dut-name>.yaml` - UDB configuration file
3. `rvmodel_macros.h` - DUT-specific macro implementations
4. `link.ld` - Linker script
5. `sail.json`, `rvtest_config.svh`, `rvtest_config.h` - Additional configs (will be auto-generated in the future)

See [config/cores/cvw/cvw-rv64gc](./config/cores/cvw/cvw-rv64gc) for a complete example configuration directory.

#### ACT Framework Configuration File

The ACT Framework configuration YAML file contains all of the top-level configuration options. It specifies the compiler and reference model along with the paths to your UDB config file, linker script, and header directory.

It should contain the following fields:

- `name`: Identifier for your DUT (used in output directories)
- `compiler_exe`: GCC or LLVM executable for compiling tests; absolute path or executable name on PATH
- `objdump_exe`: Optional; absolute path or executable name on PATH; if not provided, objdump will be skipped
- `ref_model_exe`: RISC-V Sail model executable (`sail_riscv_sim`); absolute path or executable name on PATH
- `udb_config`: Path to UDB YAML file; interpreted relative to framework config file
- `linker_script`: Path to linker script; interpreted relative to framework config file
- `dut_include_dir`: Directory containing `rvmodel_macros.h`; interpreted relative to framework config file (use `.` for same directory as config file)
- `include_priv_tests`: Optional; defaults to `True`; if set to `False`, all tests that rely on privilege modes will be skipped

See [test_config.yaml](./config/cores/cvw/cvw-rv64gc/test_config.yaml) for an example framework config file.

#### UDB Config File

A [UDB](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-unified-db) configuration file is used to specify all of the implementation details for your DUT. This includes all of the supported extensions and the value of all relevant parameters.

See [cvw-rv64gc.yaml](./config/cores/cvw/cvw-rv64gc/cvw-rv64gc.yaml) for an example and [the riscv-unified-db repo](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-unified-db) for more details.

#### `rvmodel_macros.h` DUT-Specific Macro Implementation

The ACT Framework uses a selection of assembly macros to run DUT-specific code to boot the DUT, print to a console, terminate the test, and trigger interrupts. These macros are defined and explained in detail in the [CTP](https://riscv.github.io/riscv-arch-test/ctp.html#rvmodel-macros).

**Required Macros**:

- `RVMODEL_HALT_PASS`
- `RVMODEL_HALT_FAIL`

**Printing Macros**: Can be left blank if no console is available

- `RVMODEL_IO_INIT(_R1, _R2, _R3)` (can be omitted if not needed)
- `RVMODEL_IO_WRITE_STR(_R1, _R2, _R3, _STR_PTR)`

**DUT-Specific Functions**: Can be left blank if not needed

- `RVMODEL_DATA_SECTION`
- `RVMODEL_BOOT` (can be omitted if not needed)
- `RVMODEL_ACCESS_FAULT_ADDRESS` (can be omitted if DUT does not generate some/all access faults)

**Timer Macros**: Can be left blank if machine mode is not supported.

- `RVMODEL_MTIME_ADDRESS` (can be omitted if MTIME is not implemented)
- `RVMODEL_MTIMECMP_ADDRESS` (can be omitted if MTIMECMP is not implemented)
- `RVMODEL_TIMER_INT_SOON_DELAY`

**MSIP Macro**: Required only for Sm version 1.13 and above. Can be omitted if machine software interrupts are not supported.

- `RVMODEL_MSIP_ADDRESS` (can be omitted if MSIP is not memory-mapped or not tested)

**Interrupt Macros**: Can be left blank if interrupts are not supported.

- `RVMODEL_SET_MEXT_INT(_R1, _R2)`
- `RVMODEL_CLR_MEXT_INT(_R1, _R2)`
- `RVMODEL_SET_MSW_INT(_R1, _R2)`
- `RVMODEL_CLR_MSW_INT(_R1, _R2)`
- `RVMODEL_SET_SEXT_INT(_R1, _R2)`
- `RVMODEL_CLR_SEXT_INT(_R1, _R2)`
- `RVMODEL_SET_SSW_INT(_R1, _R2)`
- `RVMODEL_CLR_SSW_INT(_R1, _R2)`
- `RVMODEL_INTERRUPT_LATENCY`

Complete examples are available for an example DUT ([config/cores/cvw/cvw-rv64gc/rvmodel_macros.h](./config/cores/cvw/cvw-rv64gc/rvmodel_macros.h)) and for the RISC-V Sail reference model ([config/sail/sail-RVA23S64/rvmodel_macros.h](./config/sail/sail-RVA23S64/rvmodel_macros.h)).

#### Linker Script

A linker script is needed to place the code and data regions in the appropriate place for the DUT's memory map. This can be customized as needed, but it must adhere to the following requirements:

- The `ENTRY` point must be `rvtest_entry_point`.
  - DUT-specific boot code can be run using the `RVMODEL_BOOT` macro, which `rvtest_entry_point` will jump to before anything else.
- There must be a `.text.init` output section that starts at `TEST_BASE`, contains the `.text.init` input section (i.e. `.text.init TEST_BASE : { *(.text.init) }`).
- There must be a `.text.rvtest` output section that contains the `.text.rvtest` input sections (i.e. `.text.rvtest . : { *(.text.rvtest) *(.text.rvtest.*) } > ram`). This must follow the `.text.init` section.
- The linker script should define a `MEMORY` region for the RAM used by the test ELF and place all standard ACT sections in that region.
  - When assigning sections to a `MEMORY` region with `> ram`, sections that rely on a previous location-counter assignment, alignment, or gap must explicitly use the current location counter as their address (for example, `.data . : { ... } > ram`).
- There must be `.rodata`, `.data`, and `.bss` output sections. The `.bss` section must define `__bss_start` and `__bss_end` for C test startup.
- The linker script must define `__stack_bottom` and `__stack_top`, using `__stack_size * __num_harts` bytes of stack space.
- There must be a `.text.rvmodel` output section for DUT-specific (RVMODEL) code, with catch-all wildcards for any remaining text sections (i.e. `.text.rvmodel . : { *(.text.rvmodel) *(.text.rvmodel.*) *(.text) *(.text.*) } > ram`). This **must** follow the data and stack sections so that variable-size model-specific code does not affect the addresses of test data symbols (such as `scratch` and `begin_signature`). This ensures the DUT ELF and the reference-model ELF agree on data addresses.

For an example linker script that should work for most basic implementations, see [config/cores/cvw/cvw-rv64gc/link.ld](./config/cores/cvw/cvw-rv64gc/link.ld). Most users should only need to modify the variables at the top of the sample linker script, before the `/* Most users should not need to modify anything below this line. */` comment:

- `RAM_ORIGIN`: starting address of the RAM region used by the ACT ELF.
- `RAM_LENGTH`: size of that RAM region.
- `TEST_BASE`: starting address of the ELF, usually the DUT reset vector. For most DUTs this is `RAM_ORIGIN`.
- `NUM_HARTS`: number of harts the test should initialize stacks for.

`STACK_SIZE` is defined below that comment and defaults to `0x20000` bytes per hart. Users with special needs can customize the lower section layout, change `STACK_SIZE`, or start at their own boot code (leaving the `RVMODEL_BOOT` macro blank) and then jump to `rvtest_entry_point`.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you modify `RAM_ORIGIN` or `RAM_LENGTH`, you also need to modify the RISC-V Sail model memory map under the `memory.regions` key in `sail.json`.

For a detailed description of the test memory layout (section ordering, contents of each section, etc.), see [docs/memory_map.md](./docs/memory_map.md).

#### Other Config Files <!-- TODO: Remove this section when these files are autogenerated -->

The framework currently relies on three other config files. All three of these files will eventually be generated from the UDB config file, but that is still a work in progress, so they need to be handwritten for now. See [config/cores/cvw/cvw-rv64gc](./config/cores/cvw/cvw-rv64gc) for examples of these files.

- `sail.json` RISC-V Sail model configuration
- `rvtest_config.svh` and `rvtest_config.h` SystemVerilog and C header files that define the supported extensions and parameter values.

### Generating Self-Checking ELFs

Once all [dependencies](#prerequisites) are installed and the [configuration files](#configuration) for your DUT have been created, you can generate the self-checking test ELFs.

#### Generate Tests and Compile ELFs

Run the following command to generate test assembly files, compile them, and create self-checking ELFs:

```bash
CONFIG_FILES=<your_config_directory>/test_config.yaml make --jobs $(nproc)
```

This will create all of the ELFs that apply to your DUT (based on the provided UDB configuration) in the `$WORKDIR/<config_name>/elfs` directory. These ELFs have the expected results compiled into them and use the provided macros and linker script.

The following variables can be set on the command line to customize the build (e.g., `DEBUG=True CONFIG_FILES=path/to/test_config.yaml make --jobs`):

| Variable              | Default                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CONFIG_FILES`        | Spike rv32/rv64 max configs                     | Space-separated list of `test_config.yaml` paths to build ELFs for.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `WORKDIR`             | `work`                                          | Directory where all build artifacts and ELFs are created.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `EXTENSIONS`          | _(empty — all extensions)_                      | Comma-separated list of extensions to generate tests for. When empty, generates tests for all extensions in the UDB config.                                                                                                           |
| `EXCLUDE_EXTENSIONS`  | _(see below)_                                   | Comma-separated list of extensions to exclude from test generation. Applied as a negative filter after `EXTENSIONS`.                                                                                                                  |
| `DEBUG`               | _(empty)_                                       | Set to `True` to enable debug output (signature objdump, trace files, and trap report). Significantly slows down ELF generation. Mutually exclusive with `FAST`.                                                                      |
| `VERBOSE`             | _(empty)_                                       | Set to `True` to enable verbose output (prints all commands). Also implies debug mode and serializes all commands (JOBS=1).                                                                                                           |
| `FAST`                | _(empty)_                                       | Set to `True` to skip objdump generation for faster builds. Makes debugging mismatches harder. Mutually exclusive with `DEBUG`.                                                                                                       |
| `CLEAN_INTERMEDIATES` | _(empty)_                                       | Set to `True` to delete each config's intermediate `build/` directory (`.sig.elf`/`.sig`/`.results`/logs) after a successful build, keeping only the ELFs. Saves disk space (useful for CI caching). Mutually exclusive with `DEBUG`. |
| `JOBS`                | Auto-detected from `make -j` flag, or CPU count | Number of parallel build jobs for test compilation. Set to `1` for debugging test hangs.                                                                                                                                              |

By default, both `CONFIG_FILES` and `WORKDIR` are relative to the `riscv-arch-test` directory. Use an absolute path if you need to specify a directory that is out-of-tree.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The default `EXCLUDE_EXTENSIONS` list excludes several privileged extensions that are still being stabilized or have known issues with the Sail reference model. See [Makefile](./Makefile) for the current list and reasons for each excluded extension.

The ACT framework first compiles signature-generating versions of the tests (with a .sig.elf suffix) in the `$WORKDIR/<config_name>/build` or `$WORKDIR/common/build` directory, then simulates these tests on the RISC-V Sail reference model and saves the signature into a `.sig` file. It then recompiles the tests with the correct results included to enable self-checking, placing the executable in the elfs directory mentioned above. The build directory contents are only of interest when troubleshooting during test development. See [LINK COMING SOON] for details.

> [!NOTE]
>
> To generate the assembly tests and coverpoints without compiling or running them, run `make tests`. This only requires `make` and `mise` to be installed.

### Running Certification Tests

All ELFs produced in the `$WORKDIR/<config_name>/elfs` directory must be run on your DUT for certification. Depending on your DUT, you may need to convert these ELFs into a format that your testbench accepts (hex files are common). It is recommended to use a script or Makefile to run all ELFs in the directory on your DUT. Some examples for this are coming soon.

Each test will print one of the following to the console:

- **PASSED**: `RVCP-SUMMARY: TEST PASSED - Test File "<test_name.S>"`
- **FAILED**: `RVCP-SUMMARY: TEST FAILED - Test File "<test_name.S>"`

### Troubleshooting

For any test that fails, additional debug information will be printed including:

- The failing PC (program counter)
- The failing instruction
- Which register mismatched
- Expected value
- Actual value

Debugging a failing test typically involves examining the object dump (.elf.objdump) file to understand the failing test. Search for the failing PC and review the test. If the actual value appears to be wrong, it is likely a bug in the DUT. If the expected value appears to be wrong, it is likely due to a configuration mismatch (see below). If it is not a configuration mismatch, then it may be a bug in the ACTs themselves, such as testing a feature whose behavior should be UNSPECIFIED and thus legitimately different between the DUT and reference model. If you believe there is a bug in the ACTs themselves, please [open an issue](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-arch-test/issues/new).

A common source of errors is configuration mismatches, so ensure that:

- Your UDB config file accurately reflects your DUT's capabilities
- The RISC-V Sail config file matches your UDB configuration and DUT
- Your `rvmodel_macros.h` macros correctly implement the required functionality
- Your linker script places code/data at the correct memory addresses

#### Debug Flag

If the standard debug information is insufficient, use the `DEBUG=True` flag to generate additional artifacts alongside each test that aid in debugging:

- **Sail trace files** (`.sig.log`) — Instruction-by-instruction trace from the Sail reference model. Useful for understanding the expected execution flow.
- **Trap report** (`.sig.trap_report`) — Human-readable summary of every trap recorded in the trap signature region. Shows cause, mode, xepc, xtval, and status bits for each trap.

These files are generated in the `$WORKDIR/<config_name>/build` directory alongside the `.sig` and `.sig.elf` files. Note that `DEBUG=True` significantly slows down ELF generation and is mutually exclusive with `FAST`. It is recommended to only enable `DEBUG` for an individual extension that is failing (use the `EXTENSIONS` variable).
