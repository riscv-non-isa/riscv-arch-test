# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI test

# Controls when the action will run. 
on:

  # Triggers the workflow on pull request events but only for the main & dev branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main , dev ]
  
  # Triggers the workflow on push events
  push:
    branches: [ main , dev ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow Actions manually
  workflow_dispatch:

   # Triggers the action 2am every day
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 2 * * *"


# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
